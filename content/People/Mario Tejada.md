# Mario Tejada


## How did I met him?
I first met Mario at the [[Conalep]] in 2018, my first impression of him was "shit! he's harry potter" - because of the way he was dressing. Also I felt a little bit jealous at first, because he seemed too smart, and indeed, he was super smart. But soon I found out that we had many things in common, such as our sense of humour and philosophy. And then we started to be closer friends
