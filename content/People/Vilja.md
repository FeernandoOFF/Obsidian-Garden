# Vilja


## How did I met him/her?
I first met her at [[Naples]]  in the ==Hostal of the Sun== which actually was a really good place to be ( See [[Italy experience]] ). While I was reading a little bit of [[How to Talk to Anyone - Leil Lowndes]] a bunch of people ran into the room that I was, they started playing Jenga and a Israeli girl started to talk to me; and that's how I joined the group. 
After a while she arrived and ask if she could join us, they gave her the chance the next round and took a while to make her move, when she finally decided to start she moved the table where she was and throw all the building down, I didn't talk to her that day. 
It wasn't until the next day [[26-Dec-2022]]
