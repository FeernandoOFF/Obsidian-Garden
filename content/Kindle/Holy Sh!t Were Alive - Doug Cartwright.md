In all my romantic relationships, I was basically screaming, Validate me! I know something’s wrong with me. Tell me I’m lovable because I don’t love myself. — location: [296](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099DH91MZ&location=296) ^ref-2262

We went through traumatic experiences. We started to put labels on ourselves. We decided we weren’t good enough. We got stuck in a box. — location: [327](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099DH91MZ&location=327) ^ref-44828

your first conscious memory. That’s where you’ll discover when you first “learned” your story, formed that belief, and created a negative thought pattern. — location: [348](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099DH91MZ&location=348) ^ref-8791

---
Because I put that story onto myself and took on that label, my relationship with myself changed from that day forward. My self-talk turned into: What’s wrong with me? Why am I the fat kid? Why am I not lovable? If I’m not lovable for who I am, how do I earn that love? And things just spiraled from there. I let that moment negatively impact my life for the next twenty-two years. — location: [360](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099DH91MZ&location=360) ^ref-57317

we often assume everyone thinks the same way as we do when they don’t. People are so caught up in their own shit. — location: [410](kindle://book?action=open&asin=B099DH91MZ&location=410) ^ref-39328
