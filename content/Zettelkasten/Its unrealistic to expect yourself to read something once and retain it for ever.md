## Its unrealistic to expect yourself to read something once and retain it for ever


### Thoughts
This is related to [[Use it or lose it]] and also to the Zettelkasten and Obsidian method in which you can [[build knowledge from bottom to top]] where little pieces of information in your brain can build to clarify a topic or [[If you only focus on connections that are already made you'll never create something new|create new relations]]
