# Binomials
Binomials are expressions (often idiomatic) where two words are joined by a conjunction (usually **and**). **The order of this words is usually fixed**. It is best to use them only in **informal** situations with one or two exceptions

- **odds and ends**: Small, unimportant things
	- `Lets get the main things packed, we can do the odds and ends later`
- **give and take**: Spirit of compromise
	- `Every relationship needs a but of give and take to be successful`
