# Card games

## Why?


#### Bullshit
3-6 Players
I first played this in the [[Eco Hostal]] the [[23-Nov-2022]] with Jamy (the australian girl) and other people.
##### Goal
Getting rid of your cards

- You distribute the cards evenly and start with the **Ace** in the middle
- Clockwise you put a card in **order** (A - 2 / 2- 3) **Facing down**
- If you don't have that card you have to lie
- Someone has to decide weather that is Bullshit or no.  If they **catch you lying** you take all the cards otherwise they take it  -> Bloff 


#### Kemps
4 cards - Even players (Team of 2)
Team Signal 
##### Goal
Get a set of 4 of the same 

- You **trade** cards until you complete
- Throw to the trash once no one wants cards
- Your **partner** has to notice that you've the set of cards
	- **But** if the other team notices it first they can call "call" and **win** 


#### Speed
2 players
- 2 Cards facing **up in the middle**
- 3 In each **side** of the table
- Split the rest

##### Goal
Getting rid of all your cards

- Takes a hand of 5 cards of their pile
- Put your cards on top of the 2 cards (piles) in the middle
- You can only pile up if your card is 1> or 1<
- If **both are suck** you pick from the piles on the sides



#### Spoons 
Object in the middle but **1 less than people**  3 objects for 4 persons
##### Goal
Set of 4 cards of the same number

Deal 4 cards 
Pass one card and try to obtain 4 of the kind
Once you get your four - **you pick your object** 




#### War
##### Goal
Adquire the whole deck of cards
Evenly 
Everyone puts a card and the highest wins 

- If both persons put 2 of the kind (and are the highest) that's war
	- Three cards facing down 
	- Flip one over and the highest takes everything on the table


#### Mafia

#### Yahtzee 

#### Object in the center - Put a card (random) and if the other has the same the quickest gets the object #todo
##### Goal 
Getting rid of all your cards

- If facing in eveyrone takes the object 
	- And put their "stagging cards" in the center
- If facing out eveyrone puts a card at the same time and if two matches the quickest has to get it
The slowest has to take "the cards stagging" from  the winner (of the same cards)
