# My problem with school


The problem by learning [[Conceptual Notes]] vs [[Sequential Notes]]

```
In my school the teacher review your notes at the end of the class to see if you copy everything that he said
```

The origin of the school

Concepts vs Know things

 It doesn't make you  a [[Generalist vs Specialist#Generalist]] because youre in one field
 And neiter makes you an [[Generalist vs Specialist#Specialist]]  because they teach you the **same** as everyone else 
 
> Get judged by reality
