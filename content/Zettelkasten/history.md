# History




## How I see the History?
There's no year zero, as the Romans didn't had the 0 in their numeric system

### History vs Pre-history
This is aproximately when writting first appear, **everything before the first writing systems is consider prehistory**

History of out species:
- <200,000 years BCE considered **the stone age**

Humans started do to things in bronce around the same time that we develop **writing**
- Egyptians (Egypt)
