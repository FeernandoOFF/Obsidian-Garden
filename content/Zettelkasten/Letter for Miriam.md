Glossary. Underlined words are the ones that reminds me of you

Dear Miriam, I’ve no words (and less in English hahaha) to express the admiration that I have for you. I’m blessed to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">have had</mark> you as a teacher I can … say that you’ve taught  me (not just English ). If not that there’s amazing people around the world - I’d like to meet again in the future. To tell you all the good things that I will have made at that moment and you to tell me how many lives have you changed at that


Dear Miriam
I have no words to express the admiration and appreciation I have for you (even less in English hehe). You have been a source of inspiration and happiness in my life and in all of us who had the fortune to have you as our teacher. 
You are an amazing person who made the experience of travelling to another country unforgettable and you were definitely a central part of my personal growth, always with your words of encouragement and attitude - thank you so much and keep it up! Appreciated 
I just hope to see you in the future and see how many lives you will have changed. In the meantime I will cherish all the classes we had, the bad jokes (on both sides) and even the days I was late or overslept.
