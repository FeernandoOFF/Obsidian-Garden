# Speaking

### Why?

### How?
- Speak to my notes and explain

No matter how much you speakers you see, it will not turn you into a speaker. Is it only speaking that will turn you into a speaker

Not just practice
Give it importance 
You can improve

Second group graded based on ammount: They started touching clay at the first moment of the experiment
