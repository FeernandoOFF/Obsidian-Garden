# Pick up lines


No talk on Parties, ask her number or ask her to go out

- body language
	- Expand hands
	- Use space

Opinion of something fun

Approach out of nowhere and sit besides them - "Sorry i'm late" 

Ask for a direction and - "where I can find your number"

Hold the camera for me recording her

Wait a second, have we met already? - Don't worry let me introduce myself again

Let her know that you won't be there for too long

Hi, what's your name? Tell be more, what is your favourite color? - ohh, so you're single. Okay, I go this way you can go that way

Grab this - my hand

 What are you doing here? - Normally I'd say work but now I think is destiny 

I found a girl and I want to take her on a date. But I'm not sure where to take her out - Suggestions? .... At what time should I pick you up?

- Party
	- 5 seconds to talk to her
	- Make her laugh and leave
	- Let me easy for you
