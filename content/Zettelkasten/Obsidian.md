# What is obsidian?


> [!NOTE] Philosophy
> Obsidian lets you create the note first and then lets you organise however you want - [[build knowledge from bottom to top]]

Obsidian is a note taking app with a different approach to apps like Notion. It uses links and backlinks to create relations between concepts and notes, letting the knowledge grow by his own and create structures between topics

## How does it works?

Obsidian uses [[Markdown]] as file format, with some [[My obsidian setup#Obsidian controls|shortcuts]] in the app to make your life easier (although you can configure them) and it is based in a **Node-Link** system which makes the **connection** of new ideas super easy, so lets start by creating ideas (aka notes or nodes) and link them.

Obsidian is useful when you start creating a bunch of ideas and try to link ideas that **could not be linked** in another way.
Your mind can be undefined and abstracted but you can start building knowledge from bits of knowlede - aka [[build knowledge from bottom to top]]

### Vault
A vault is basically the folder where all the **files and configurations** will be **saved** so if you want to have things separated you could create another vault, although I use the same vault for everything. I just create one for test porpoises 

### Pages 

> [!Note] Recommendation
> Tun off "legacy editor" in the settings and turn on "live preview"

To **start creating notes**  you can press  `âŒ˜+N`, this will create a note (although I recommend using  the command `Quick Switch` and create a binding - [[My obsidian setup]]) this will create a note which you can later rename you can start writing in markdown format

### Links

> [!NOTE] Recommendation
> If you think that a concept will be useful or you have the intention to increase the knowledge about a topic, you should create a link for it
- Concept
- Reuse

This is where the real **power of obsidian** comes into play,  you can start linking notes with `[[your Note]]` - this way of linking is called `Wikilink` and can be turn on in the settings, while writing your note's name you'll notice that obsidian will auto suggest notes, this becomes really handy as your vault grows or you have a concept that you're looking for - this will start  increasing  your [[#Graph view]]

#### Headings
Another way of linking can be referencing [[Markdown#Headings]] within a note (this can be in other or in the same) and turns to be a really useful. 
- Rename
- MOCS 
- Insert concept 

#### Any block
Another very useful feature (although is not suuper used) is the ability to link to any sentence with the `^` symbol - Really useful when creating [[Maps of Content]] and **reuse** concepts
