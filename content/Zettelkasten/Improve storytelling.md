# Improve storytelling

Storytelling is something we all do - is **human**; is how we understand the world around us and how we create bonds and laugh 

You're a storyteller weather you like it or not

Sometimes reallity is too complex; Stories give it form

1. Be interested
2. First person - Same emotional journey that you've experienced
