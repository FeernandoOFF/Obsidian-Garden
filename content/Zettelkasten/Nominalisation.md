# Nominalisation

The process of convert verbs to a noun form - this is because [[written english vs spoken english]]

### Reasons for using nominalisation

#### Making texts impersonal and authoritative
By turning **actions into nouns** we can make the text sound **less personal** and more authoritative. **We don't use personal pronouns (I, you, she, he )** as much


> [!NOTE] Example
> 

- Nominalisation: 
Following a bee sting **the normal reaction** is **burning pain, redness and irritation**, In this situation there my be **swelling** in the area around the bite
- Verb form
 Then really quickly **my foot began to go red and swell up**. It just got bigger and bigger

#### Adding Information
When using nouns we can do things such as: **count, describe and classify** a noun
We **can't** do the same with **verbs**

- **count**: the ==two== charts
- **describe**: the two ==coloured== charts
- **classify**: the two coloured ==bar== chars

#### Avoiding repetition
We can avoid repetition when referring back to a previous mentioned Idea
eg:
```
The number of unemployed increased by 5% last month. The reason for **this increase** is still unclear
```
- Also to **paraphrase** what has been said [[IELTS#Listening]] and [[IELTS#Reading]]

#### Parts of speech
As we know we can change **verbs into nouns** but can we change another [[Parts of Speech]]? We can!

##### Adjectives into nouns
- The cathedral is **tall** and can be seen from all over the town
- The cathedral's **height** makes it visible all over the town
