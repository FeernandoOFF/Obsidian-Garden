# Obsidian for book summary

We should start first with: **Why to take notes and how to get the most**
![[How to get the most of a book]]

## How do I use obsidian?
Mainly every recomendation of the how to get the most of a book is in the [[Book template]] - with some automated tweaks such as:
- Template section created
- Automatic action database created #todo
- Link between book highlights, summary, and Status in [[Bookshelf]] 
- Use **mind map** to recall ideas
