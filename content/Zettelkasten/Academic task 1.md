### My answer

The two charts above **present the percentage of carbon dioxide emitted**. While the Pie chart shows the biggest Global polluters in 2015, the Bar chart presents the amount of metric tones per capita in the same year

### Introduction

> [!NOTE] Base words
> The two, four. **compare**, **demonstrate** the **biggest, price ,etc**.by...

The two charts **compare** data about the biggest carbon dioxide producers **by country and per person** in 2015

### Overview

> [!NOTE] Base form
> Overall, [It is clear, it can be seen, is notorious], was the **biggest, smallest**

Overall it is clear that although China and the USA **generated almost half** of the world's emission that year, the highest polluters on an individual level were Saudi Arabians. **Interestingly, despite being** in the top 3 emitters globally, the developing nations of China and India **were not** in the highest CO2 producers on a per person **basis**. 

### Key features (AKA pure data)

> [!NOTE] Vocabulary
> According to... produced...the other were smaller **at XX%**, followed


According to the pie chart, 31% of the CO2 produced in 2015 **came from** China, followed by a 17% coming from USA. India, Russia, Japan and Germany **accounted** approximately  one fifth and the rest of carbon dioxide came from all other nations in the world.

**In terms** of the emission per person, despite not being in the top world CO2 producers, Saudi Arabia, Australia Canada and South Korea produced not less than 12 tons of carbon dioxide per person.

## Examples...

### Example 1 (Pie chart)
The amount of money that a children's charity located in the USA spent and received in one year, 2016.
![[Screenshot 2022-11-12 at 10.45.28.png|400]]
- Data
	- 

#### Introduction
The two chars presented above ==demonstrate== the revenue sources and expenditures in 2016 for children's charity in the USA. Overall, it ==can be seen/is notorious== that  donated food ==accounted== for the majority of income, while program service accounted for the ==most expenditure==. **Total revenue sources** slightly **exceeded**  outgoings.

#### Overview

In detail, donated food **provided** the most of the revenue for the charity, at 86%. **Similarly with regard** to expenditures, one category, program services, **accounted** for **nearly** all of the outgoings, at 95%

The other categories were **much smaller**. Community contributions which where the **second largest** revenue source at 10% of the total income, and this **being followed by** program revenue. Investment income, government grants, and other income were very small sources of revenue, **accounting for only 0.8% combined**.

// Mine
We can see an **overall**  ==match== between the revenue sources and expenditures, this last being drastically represented by a 95% of financial from program services followed by fundraising and management and general. On the other hand the revenue sources are mainly financed by Donated Food, Community Contributors and Program revenue.

#### Key features

It is drastically notorious that the revenue sources depends greatly on Donated food, this being represented by a 86% of the fundings, while the main expenditure are program services, this being the 95% of the expenditures.

### Example 2 (Diagram)

![[Pasted image 20221112114205.png|400]]
- what does the diagram explains?
- Overall steps
- How
- Process

The diagram explains **the way in which** bricks are made for the building industry. Overall there are **7 steps** beginning with, culminating with..

**To begin**, the clay used to make the bricks is dug up from the ground by a large digger. This clay is **then placed** onto a metal grid, which is **used to** break up the clay into smaller pieces. A roller assists in this process. 

Following this, sand and water are added to the clay, and this mixture is turned into bricks by either placing it into a mould or using a wire cutter. Next, these bricks are placed in an oven to dry for 24 – 48 hours. 

In the **subsequent stage**, the bricks go through a heating and cooling process. They are heated in a kiln at a moderate and then a high temperature (ranging from 200c to 1300c), followed by a cooling process in a chamber for 2 – 3 days. Finally, the bricks are packed and delivered to their destinations.

### Example  (4 pie charts)
![[Pasted image 20221112114753.png|400]]

The four pie charts **compare the electricity** generated **between** Germany and France during 2009, and it is **measured** in billions kWh. **Overall, it can be seen** that conventional thermal was the main source of electricity in Germany, **whereas** nuclear was the main source in France.
