# Stative and Dynamic verbs

### Dynamic verbs
There are many types of dynamic verbs, but most of them describe activities or events which can begin and finish. 

Dynamic verbs, as you can see from the table above, can be used in the simple and perfect forms _(plays, played, has played, had played)_ as well as the continuous or progressive forms _(is playing, was playing, has been playing, had been playing)_.

| Dynamic Verb | Type             | Example                                                     |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| play         | activity         | She's **playing** tennis / She plays **tennis** every Friday        |
| melt         | process          | The snow **melts** every spring / The snow is **melting** right now |
| hit          | momentary action | When a boxer **hits** another / When a boxer is **hitting** another |
|              |                  |                                                             |



### Stative verbs or State verbs
Stative verbs usually refer to a state or condition which is quite static or unchanging. They can be divided into verbs of **perception** or **cognition** (which refer to things in the mind), or verbs of **relation** (which describe the relationships between things). Here are some examples:

Note that we CANNOT use these verbs in the continuous (progressive) forms; you CAN'T say "*Yong is owning three cars." Owning is a state, not an action, so it is always in the simple form.

| State verb | Type       | Example                          |
| ---------- | ---------- | -------------------------------- |
| hate       | perception | I hate chocolate                 |
| believe    | perception | She believes in UFOs.            |
| Contain    | relation   | The box contains 24 cans of soda |
| own        | relation   | She owns three houses!                                 |
