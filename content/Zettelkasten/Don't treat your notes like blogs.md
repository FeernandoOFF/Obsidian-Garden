# Don't treat your notes like blogs


You cannot write your notes as if they were blogs. This idea opposes to [[learn in public]] and [[teaching is the best way to learn]]
But at the same time I think that we should separate things that are for us and things that we can explain to other  person, as [[we talk to our selves different than we talk to other people]]
