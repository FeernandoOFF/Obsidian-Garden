# Generalist vs Specialist

Compete with everybody - you wont be good at anything

Human - The generalist of the nature
Accomplish by being specialist, you rub yourself of your humanity



## Specialist
> Helps the development

**Mastery**
Circle of Accelerated Returns
Getting Better ->Getting Easier -> Spend more hours

- Fixed on a path 
- Personality changes over time (Specially 18-30)
- No ability to pivot - change
- Cementery of over specialised people

## Generalist
> Sufficiently good to create meaningful things

- [[Impostor syndrome]]
> Feel unqualified for every project that you do - You'll figure out on the way
- Good enough to profit for what are you doing
- Profit for your learning curve - make it public [[learn in public]]

Wide range of experiences make you better at learning
Better **problem solvers** expose to more analogies - (i.e Learn English trough French)

Circle of Accelerated Adaptation
Wide set of skills -> More analogies & Learning methods -> Learn new skills faster (<--)

The knowledge has not advaned too much compared to the access to it

Problem with this  is that it seems that the knowledge is **not related**
