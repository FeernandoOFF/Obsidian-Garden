# Ireland Experience


Many think that live abroad (specially coming from a latinoamerican perspective ) It's automatically an upgrade in your life, which in many cases, it is. But sometimes we forget about [[the importance of people]], specially in your [[How you should live your life#Young adult|younger years]]  where you learn and define yourself based on the people and the things that surround you. Well, this is my experience leaving Mexico and coming to Ireland at 18 years old.


The first time that I've heard about Ireland and the opportunities that offers, was In January of 2022 (Wow now I remembered that in 2012 was "The end of the world" ) when I was researching about English courses in Canada, at the moment the COVID was still a problem 
the 18th of March, looking for an improvement of my profesional career and a new challenge for me - I wanted to see how much I was capable of in another country.
