Nebo Documents are designed for structured, text-led note-taking.

Let's try writing. Complete this sentence (and follow the lines - it enhances the recognition):

The field that displays above your writing is the conversion preview.
It shows how Nebo interprets your handwriting and can be switched off via … menu.

Convert the above sentence to typed text by double-tapping it with your finger.

Erase or edit content using your pen:

Try it:

Scratch me out to erase me.

The Nebo Document automatically sorts your writing into text blocks. Tap a text block with your finger, then move or resize it.

I'm a little text block,
short and stout.
Tap me, move me,
stretch me out!

Let's do more with this block ⬆️. Tap to select it again.

Now try the following:
- Tap ¶ to insert a title or a list.
- Tap the text block a second time for inline editing.
- Now long press on some text with your finger to display the menu and change the formatting.
