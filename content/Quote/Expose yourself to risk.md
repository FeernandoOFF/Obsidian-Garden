## Expose yourself to risk

> In my opinion, it's now critically important to get into the **real world** and really **challenge yourself** --expose yourself to risk -- put yourself into situations where you'll **succeed or fail** by your **own decisions** and actions, and where the **success or failure is highly visible**
