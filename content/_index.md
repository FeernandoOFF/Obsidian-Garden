Hi there, you user of the web. You just came across with my digital garden! 

### Me
If you don't know who am I, well I'm Fernando Obregon, I'm a software developer ,currently living in Dublin, Ireland. You can stay and read if you're interested about [tech](tech), [history](Zettelkasten/history.md) or [productivity](Zettelkasten/productivity.md)


### My goal

My goal is to provide easy information for people to develop their own things (AKA [[DIY in Tech]])  so everyone is aware of;
- [[How the internet works]]
- [[How your devices work]]
- [[Make your life easier by removing friction]]


### Any news?

Currently I'm learning [[astro]] and some of [[iOS]] development
